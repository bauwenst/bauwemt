\chapter{Foreword}

\section*{What you should know before reading}\vspace{-0.5em}
Not much, really. It helps to have experience in \LaTeX{}, but I give sufficiently many examples to show how everything works.

\section*{Dank}\vspace{-0.5em}
Don't forget to thank everyone!

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mama, papa, brothers, sisters, pets, coke suppliers, ...
    \item Dirk Vandepitte, evidently.
\end{itemize}

Hope this template helps!

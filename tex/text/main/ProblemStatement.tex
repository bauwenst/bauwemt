\chapter{Problem Statement}\label{chap:questions}
Having explored all the other viable \LaTeX{} thesis templates in \autoref{chap:literature}, we automatically fall into the following research question.
\begin{question}\label{q:problems}
	Can we make a better thesis template than \textsc{kulemt}?
\end{question}
The answer to \autoref{q:problems} is obviously a resounding "yes". The rest of this document is laid out as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item In \autoref{chap:bauwemt}, I present my own template, \repo, and how to install it.
	\item In \autoref{chap:functionality}, I provide real examples for doing all the things you likely need in a thesis.
\end{itemize}

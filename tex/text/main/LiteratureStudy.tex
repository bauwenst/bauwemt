\chapter{Literature Study}\label{chap:literature}
In \autoref{chap:intro}, I took you through the train of thoughts that led me to publishing my thesis template. It pays to know which alternatives already exist out there.

\section{kulemt}
\href{https://eng.kuleuven.be/docs/kulemt}{\emph*{kulemt}} is the original \LaTeX{} template for \underline{e}ngineering \underline{m}aster's \underline{t}heses. Its documentation is way more convoluted than it should be, the results look mid, and it didn't even do half the things I needed it to do.

\subsection{Derivatives by other faculties}
Sadly, kulemt even has \href{https://github.com/KatelijneCaerts/Latex-template-Wetenschappen}{offspring}.

\subsection{KUL on Overleaf}
KUL actually has a presence on the public Overleaf template repository, see \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ku-leuven-faculty-of-engineering-science-masters-thesis-template/xbjfxrbspkvs}{here} and \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/ku-leuven}{here}. I wouldn't trust any of these though.

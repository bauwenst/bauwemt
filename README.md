# bauwemt
A better LaTeX template for engineering master's theses than kulemt.

## Example
- [My 177-page master's thesis](https://bauwenst.github.io/cdn/doc/pdf/2023/masterthesis.pdf) was typeset with `bauwemt`.
- `bauwemt` itself *is* a stripped-down thesis. You can compile it to get a PDF that gives tips on how to write a thesis and how to use `bauwemt`.

## Installation
If you already have LaTeX and TeXstudio installed, just **download** this repository and start working. Do **not** make a fork, unless you want your thesis source code to be publicly available.

## Features
Out-of-the-box support for nice-looking:
- Overall style: book margins, chapter headings, captions, hyperlink colours ...;
- List of figures, tables, and algorithms;
- Appendices;
- Bibliography (author-year citations that abbreviate to 1 author if more than 2);
- Index;
- Algorithms;
- Code listings;

... and comes with a pre-determined folder structure to keep all your files organised from the start.

Contains very specific fixes for doing things like:
- Citing an author in a section title, and having it appear correctly in the page headings.

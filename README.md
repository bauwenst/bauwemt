# bauwemt
A better LaTeX template for engineering master's theses than kulemt.

Out-of-the-box support for nice-looking:
- Overall style: book margins, chapter headings, captions, hyperlink colours ...;
- List of figures, tables, and algorithms;
- Appendices;
- Bibliography (author-year citations that abbreviate to 1 author if more than 2);
- Index;
- Algorithms;
- Code listings;

... and comes with a pre-determined folder structure to keep all your files organised from the start.

Contains very specific fixes for doing things like:
- Citing an author in a section title, and having it appear correctly in the page headings.
